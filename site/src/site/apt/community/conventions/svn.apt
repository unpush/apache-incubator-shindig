Apache Shindig SVN Conventions

 This document describes how developers should use SVN, our SCM.

* Subversion Configuration

 Before committing files in subversion repository, you need to read the
 {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html#https-svn}Committer Subversion Access}}
 document and you must set your svn client with this properties file:
 {{{https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shindig/trunk/etc/svn-props}svn-props}}

* {Commit Message Template}

  Based on {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html#applying-patches}ASF committer's FAQ}}, the commits should
  have a message that follows this template:

+-----+
[issue1, issue2] <<comment>>
Submitted by: (when it was a patch, put that persons name there)

o some comments
+-----+

  Where:

  * <<issue>> can be omitted if there was no relevant JIRA issue, though it is strongly encouraged to create one for
  significant changes.

  * <<Submitted by>> only needs to be specified when a patch is being applied for a non-committer.

  * <<comments>> some words about the commits.

  []

* Apply User Patch

 By default, the committer should apply the patch without any <<major>> modifications. In a second step, the committer
 could apply any changes as usual.

* Edit Commit Message

 If you want to edit a commit message, you could call:

+-----+
svn pe svn:log --revprop -r XXX
+-----+

 where <<XXX>> is the wanted version

* Other useful Subversion commands while developing

 If you've done a chunk of work and you would like ditch your changes and start from scratch use this command to
 revert to the original checkout:

---
$ svn revert -R .
---

 The <<<-R>>> argument means that the command will recurse down all directories and revert all changes.

 Before committing code to the Subversion repository we always set the <<<svn:ignore>>> property on the directory
 to prevent some files and directories to be checked in. We always exclude the IDE project files and the <<<target/>>>
 directory. Instead of keeping all of the excludes in mind all the time it's useful to put them all in a file and
 reference the file with the <<<-F>>> option:

---
$ svn propset svn:ignore -F ~/bin/svnignore .
---

 An example svnignore file:

---
target
*~
*.log
.classpath
.project
*.ipr
*.iws
*.iml
---
