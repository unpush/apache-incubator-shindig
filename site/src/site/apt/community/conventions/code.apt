Shindig Code Style And Code Conventions

  This document describes how developers and contributors should write code. The reasoning of these styles and
  conventions is mainly for consistency, readability and maintainability reasons.

* Generic Code Style And Convention

  All working files (java, xml, others) should respect the following conventions:

  * <<License Header>>: Always add the current {{{http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#headers}ASF license header}}
  in all versionned files.

  * <<Trailing Whitespaces>>: Remove all trailing whitespaces. If your are an Eclipse user, you could use the
  {{{http://andrei.gmxhome.de/anyedit/}Anyedit Eclipse Plugin}}.

  []

  and the following style:

  * <<Indentation>>: <<Never>> use tabs!

  * <<Line wrapping>>: Always use a 100-column line width.

  []

  <<Note>>: The specific styles and conventions, listed in the next sections, could override these generic rules.

* {Java}

** {Java Code Style}

  The full Shindig for Java is described in our {{{http://cwiki.apache.org/SHINDIGxSITE/java-style.html}Wiki}}.

** {Java Code Convention}

  ongoing

** {Javadoc Code Convention}

  Our Javadoc code convention is mainly:

  * No author tag

  * No version tag
